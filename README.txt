matrices



program requirements:

	capabilities:
		relatively easy CLI interface, ideally through menus and prompts
		step by step gauss-jordan elimination (priority 1)
		matrix mathematics (priority 2)
		vector mathematics (priority 3)
	
	structure:
	separating use from definition and separating definition from declaration,
		ideally, so that others can use it with relatively little hassle.
